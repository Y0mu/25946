# Solaris assignments

All programs are compiled and run on Solaris from their respective directories
with `make`. The generated executables are ignored by Git.

| Task | Program | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | `setuid_test` | `./setuid_test` (see `Task_3/README.md`) |
| 4 | `list_strings` | `./list_strings` (finish input with a line beginning `.`) |
| 5 | `line_lookup` | `./line_lookup ../../Task_5/Task_5.txt` |
| 6 | `line_lookup_alarm` | `./line_lookup_alarm ../../Task_5/Task_5.txt` |
| 7 | `line_lookup_mmap` | `./line_lookup_mmap ../../Task_5/Task_5.txt` |
| 8 | `locked_editor` | `EDITOR=vi ./locked_editor test.txt` (see locking note below) |
| 9 | `process_manager` | `./process_manager ../../Task_9/Task_9.txt` |
| 10 | `run_command` | `./run_command sh -c 'exit 7'` |
| 11 | `execvpe_demo` | `./execvpe_demo env` |
| 16 | `one_key` | `./one_key` (answer with one key, no Enter) |
| 17 | `line_editor` | `./line_editor` (interactive terminal; Ctrl-D on an empty line exits) |
| 18 | `my_ls` | `./my_ls /etc/passwd /tmp /dev/null` |
| 19 | `match_files` | `./match_files` (enter `*.c`) |
| 20 | `match_paths` | `./match_paths` (enter `../Task_1?/Makefile`) |
| 21 | `beeper` | `./beeper` (Ctrl-C rings; Ctrl-\\ reports the count and exits) |
| 25 | `pipe_upper` | `./pipe_upper` (type text, then Ctrl-D to finish) |
| 26 | `popen_upper` | `./popen_upper` (type text, then Ctrl-D) |
| 27 | `count_blank` | `./count_blank text.txt` |
| 28 | `sorted_random` | `./sorted_random` |

Task 6 deliberately reuses the line-index implementation from Task 5 and adds
the five-second alarm. Task 7 uses `mmap` instead of `read`/`lseek` for file
access and uses standard I/O for output after the signal handler sets a flag.

Task 17 edits one logical line at a time in a terminal. Backspace removes a
character, Ctrl-U clears the line, Ctrl-W removes the last word, and words wrap
at 40 columns. Task 18 reports file metadata without entering directories.

Task 21 handles SIGINT and SIGQUIT without using unsafe stdio calls inside signal
handlers. Task 25 sends standard input from a parent process through a pipe to
its child, which converts ASCII letters to uppercase and prints the result.

Task 8 holds an `fcntl` write lock while an editor runs through `system`.
Advisory locking only affects cooperating programs. Mandatory locking requires
the file's set-group-ID bit, no group execute bit, and filesystem support;
use a disposable group-writable test file, and restore its original mode after
the classmate experiment. This program does not silently change file permissions.

The instructor's repository did not contain a Task 8 statement when these
solutions were prepared. No Task 8 solution is invented here.
